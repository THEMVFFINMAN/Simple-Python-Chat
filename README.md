# Simple-Python-Chat


Just going through some socket stuff and made a really small python client and server chat program. 

I tested it on Windows and Xubuntu and it should be cross platform


Due to problems with things like select and getch, you will only receive letters if you send letters. I might 
look into that later but it'd be platform specific
